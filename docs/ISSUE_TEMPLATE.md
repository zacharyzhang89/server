I tried a Orc rogue on PTR server. I found the racial talent Blood Fury does not add exact 25% AP when I have a T2 set on. It is around 18% AP added by Blood Fury. When without any gears on, the Blodd Fury gives 24.8% AP, which is close to what it should be. I think there is some part of the AP has not calculated right with Blood Fury. Maybe some stats from the gears not being counted? Like agi, str, or AP from the gear or enchants?
